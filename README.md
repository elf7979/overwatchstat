# overwatchstat
This code is for crawling overwatch league players data
It doesn't go deepr than EDA level due to limitation from gathering limited data from official overwatch league API

This code defines player's level based on elimination per death
Player's levels are fallen into three categories
 - low performer
 - avg-performer
 - super-performer

The code compares elimination per death data of top twenties in the league to of top twenties in offense role

Also, it compares two regions' elimination per death data, Asia and North America
It ends up with writing compared results in excel file format
